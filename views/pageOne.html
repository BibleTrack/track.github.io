                <h1>What is the Meaning of Life?</h1>
                <p class="lead my-5">Life was created by God. Col. 1:16,“…all things were created by Him and for Him.”
                    God loves us
                    and when we love Him, and honor Him, it gives meaning to life. In Rev 4:11,“You are worthy,
                    our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for You created all things…” God
                    created YOU and He loves YOU and wants to have a personal relationship with YOU. But there is
                    a problem. You are cut off from God because of your sin. Ro. 3:23, “for all have sinned and fall
                    short of the glory of God.” Have you ever told a lie? (If you say you haven’t you’re lying!) Have
                    you ever taken something that’s not yours, even something small? (Everyone has.) You are a
                    liar and a thief. Because of your sin, your relationship with God is broken and you will end up in
                    hell if you die this way. That’s also why life may seem meaningless to you. But there is hope!
